🌟 About Me:

Aspiring Web Developer currently studying at TUC Yrkeshögskola in the Web Development Program. 🚀 Passionate about creating functional, aesthetic, and user-focused websites. Skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and SQL. Experienced with modern web development frameworks such as ASP.NET Core, Razor Pages, MVC, Blazor, and Entity Framework Core. Strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Agile methodologies.

Also familiar with CMS and publishing tools including WordPress, WooCommerce, and Umbraco.

📚 Current Focus:

I am currently working on UX and Design for Developers. The course emphasizes:

- **Accessibility** (WCAG 2.1/2.2), semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and contrast  
- **Designing and interpreting layouts in Figma**, with attention to flow, hierarchy, and components  
- **Writing effective UX copy** (buttons, labels, messages) that guides user behavior  
- **Applying Mobile First principles** and responsive design techniques using flexbox, grid, and media queries  
- **Conducting user tests**, analyzing behavior, and iterating designs based on feedback 

Through hands-on labs and analysis, I’m refining my ability to think from the user’s perspective while balancing technical structure and real-world constraints

💻 Some of My Past Projects:

2024 - "Internet’s Development History" Website: My first ever website, created during the HTML and CSS with Agile Methods course. It features:
A simple, visually engaging design.
Highlights of influential figures like Tim Berners-Lee, Vint Cerf, Google, and Elon Musk.
Custom logo inspired by my domain name, VelkynSpire.

2025 - "The Vault" – Dungeons & Dragons-Themed E-commerce Site
My first full WordPress project, created during the course Publiceringsverktyg at TUC Yrkeshögskola. It includes:
• A functioning WooCommerce store
• Custom CSS design inspired by the Underdark (D&D)
• Product-linked blog posts, GTranslate, and user roles
• Contact form (WPForms) and analytics (Independent Analytics)

### 🔧 Featured Group Project: [TechPulse_GroupVersion](https://github.com/pamnyb0/TechPulse_GroupVersion)

As part of a collaborative course project, I led multiple integration and debugging efforts in a simulated e-commerce platform built with **C#**, **ASP.NET Core MVC**, and **Entity Framework**. The application was structured into modules representing various business functionalities (authentication, product catalog, order handling, etc.).

**My contributions included:**

- 🧠 **Planning and Orchestration:** I took ownership of integrating Modules 1, 2, 3, and 5 across different team contributors.  
- 🛠 **Debugging & Compatibility Fixes:** Analyzed code conflicts and corrected cross-module issues to ensure runtime stability and feature cohesion.  
- 🔐 **Authentication Logic (Module 3):** Implemented and debugged admin login functionality, including secure access to order histories.  
- 🧪 **Testing and Validation:** Created and followed structured testing scenarios to ensure UI flow, database integrity, and logic isolation.  
- 📑 **Documentation:** Authored detailed logs of module-specific fixes and integration steps to assist team coordination and future maintenance.  
- 🤝 **Version Control Workflow:** Used Git branching strategies and conflict resolution techniques to maintain a clean commit history.

This project was a crash course in *real-world complexity*: debugging other people's code, understanding foreign architecture, communicating across team boundaries, and delivering results under pressure.

> 📌 _"This project strengthened my ability to work autonomously, manage dependencies across modules, and document solutions for team alignment. It also deepened my practical understanding of MVC architecture, session handling, and user role logic in ASP.NET."_ 

✨ Looking to Collaborate On:

Frontend and web design projects.
Opportunities to refine my skills in agile workflows and team development.

🎉 **Fun Fact:**  
I designed a personal logo that's been featured in several of my school projects. I spent quite a bit of time fine-tuning the transparency and quality to get it just right.  
*Thank you, decades-old Photoshop skills, still holding up strong.*

Feel free to connect if you're into web development, want to collaborate or want to share feedback on any of my projects!

🌟 About Me:

Aspiring Web Developer currently studying at TUC Sweden AB – Yrkeshögskola in the Web Development Program. 🚀 Passionate about creating functional, aesthetic, and user-focused websites. Skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and SQL. Experienced with modern web development frameworks such as ASP.NET Core, Razor Pages, MVC, Blazor, and Entity Framework Core. Strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Agile methodologies.

Also familiar with CMS and publishing tools including WordPress, WooCommerce, and Umbraco.

📚 Current Focus:

I am currently working on UX and Design for Developers. The course emphasizes:

- **Accessibility** (WCAG 2.1/2.2), semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and contrast  
- **Designing and interpreting layouts in Figma**, with attention to flow, hierarchy, and components  
- **Writing effective UX copy** (buttons, labels, messages) that guides user behavior  
- **Applying Mobile First principles** and responsive design techniques using flexbox, grid, and media queries  
- **Conducting user tests**, analyzing behavior, and iterating designs based on feedback 

Through hands-on labs and analysis, I’m refining my ability to think from the user’s perspective while balancing technical structure and real-world constraints

💻 Some of My Past Projects:

2024 - "Internet’s Development History" Website: My first ever website, created during the HTML and CSS with Agile Methods course. It features:

✍️ Care more about content creation than pure technical coding?

In addition to developing software, I build highly structured narratives, including a fiction project rooted in the Forgotten Realms universe of Dungeons & Dragons, designed to align fully with established canon across 30+ official sources, and an original fantasy setting inspired by Nordic mythology, Iron Age Scandinavia, and regional folklore. This disciplined approach to worldbuilding deepens my skills in system thinking, consistency, and user immersion, qualities I bring into all creative and technical projects.

✨ Looking to Collaborate On:

Frontend and web design projects.
Opportunities to refine my skills in agile workflows and team development.

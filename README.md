🌟 About Me:

Aspiring Web Developer currently studying at **TUC Yrkeshögskola** in the Web Development Program. 🚀 Passionate about creating functional, aesthetic, and user-focused websites.

Skilled in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and SQL**. Experienced with modern web development frameworks such as **ASP.NET Core, Web API, EF Core, Razor Pages, MVC, and Blazor**. Strong foundation in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** using the **Arrange–Act–Assert structure**, exposure to **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**, and Agile methodologies.   

Also familiar with CMS and publishing tools including **WordPress, WooCommerce**, and **Umbraco**

📚 Current Focus:

As part of my web development program, I’m currently working through a UX and Design course. The course emphasizes:

- **Accessibility** (WCAG 2.1/2.2), semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and contrast  
- **Designing and interpreting layouts in Figma**, with attention to flow, hierarchy, and components  
- **Writing effective UX copy** (buttons, labels, messages) that guides user behavior  
- **Applying Mobile First principles** and responsive design techniques using flexbox, grid, and media queries  
- **Conducting user tests**, analyzing behavior, and iterating designs based on feedback 

Through hands-on labs and analysis, I’m refining my ability to think from the user’s perspective while balancing technical structure and real-world constraints

💻 Some of My Past Projects:

2024 - "Internet’s Development History" Website: My first ever website, created during the HTML and CSS with Agile Methods course. It features:
A simple, visually engaging design.
Highlights of influential figures like Tim Berners-Lee, Vint Cerf, Google, and Elon Musk.
Custom logo inspired by my domain name, VelkynSpire.

### 🔧 Featured Group Project: [TechPulse_GroupVersion](https://github.com/pamnyb0/TechPulse_GroupVersion)

As part of the *Fördjupning Programmering* course, I participated in a collaborative development of a simulated e-commerce platform using **C#**, **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **ASP.NET Core Web API**, and **Entity Framework Core**. This large-scale group project was divided into modular units representing key business features such as authentication, product catalog, order handling, and admin dashboards.

**My contributions included:**

- **🧠 Integration Planning & Coordination**  
  Took ownership of integrating Modules 1, 2, 3, and 5 across multiple team members' repositories, ensuring architectural cohesion and cross-module communication.

- **🛠️ Debugging & Compatibility Fixes**  
  Identified, reproduced, and resolved runtime issues related to view-model mismatches, state inconsistencies, and controller logic across merged modules.

- **🔐 Authentication & Admin Logic (Module 3)**  
  Built and tested secure login workflows for admin users. Implemented access controls to ensure order history and management views were role-restricted.

- **🧪 Unit Testing using xUnit**  
  Created test cases following the `Arrange-Act-Assert` pattern to validate critical service layer logic. Simulated error scenarios and boundary cases for login flows and product listings.

- **🌐 ASP.NET Core Web API Endpoints**  
  Participated in the implementation of RESTful API endpoints used to fetch and persist order and product data. Ensured controller responses matched frontend expectations.

- **📑 Documentation**  
  Maintained a detailed changelog, setup instructions, and developer notes across the modules I managed. Ensured teammates could trace logic, understand former mistakes and continue development with minimal friction.

- **🤝 Version Control & Git Workflow**  
  Merged and rebased branches, resolved merge conflicts, and helped enforce consistent Git practices including descriptive commit messages and PR reviews.

> 📌 _“This project gave me hands-on experience in handling architectural complexity, integrating REST-style Web API endpoints, and coordinating with a team under realistic development pressure. It also sharpened my practical skills in session handling, user roles, and MVC-based design.”_

✨ Looking to Collaborate On:

Frontend and web design projects.
Opportunities to refine my skills in agile workflows and team development.

🔍 I'm also looking for internship opportunities (LIA) as part of my education:  
• **LIA 1**: Week 33–40 (Aug–Oct ’25)  
• **LIA 2**: Week 50–14 (Dec–Mar ’26)

Whether it's an internship, freelance gig, or creative dev partnership, I’d love to hear from you!

🎉 **Fun Fact:**  
I designed a personal logo that's been featured in several of my school projects. I spent quite a bit of time fine-tuning the transparency and quality to get it just right.  
*Thank you, decades-old Photoshop skills, still holding up strong.*

Feel free to connect if you're into web development, enjoy sharing feedback, or see potential for collaboration! 👩‍💻
